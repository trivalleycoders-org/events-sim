# Events Simulation

This project was started as an experiment to better understand lifecycle events when using React Router. The component names, e.g., EventCards, come from the [events-client app](https://github.com/trivalleycoders-org/events-client)

The project slowly evolved into a demo app. That means
- it illustrates some key concepts
- the intent is that you can change things around and see what changes
- to avoid introducing abstractions that those with less experience might not understand, there is a good amount of repetitive code that could have been abstracted out as well as some other sub-optimal things
